<h3>1. Purpose</h3>

This laboratory work intends to let you understand how to code and run
RMI programs and mobile agents, so that you can focus on your HW3's
code design.

<h3>2. Statement of Work</h3>

<b>Since we have less than 1 hour for Lab 3, let's focus on item 3: MyAgent.</b>

<ol>
<li> Read <a href="hw3.pdf">program 3's specification</a> carefully to
understand how to run RMI and UWAgent.

<li> Redesign the lab work 1's client/server programs with RMI. In
other words, your client program should call the following server function:
<pre>
   double[] sqrt( double[] array )
</pre>
This function receives an array of doubles, updates each array element with
its square root, and returns the modified array back to a client.

<li> Code a simple mobile agent, say MyAgent.java that migrates to
uw1-320-20, thereafter uw1-320-21, and finally uw1-320-22 in this
order as printing out "hop", "step", and "jump" at a respective site.

</ol>

<h3>3. Related Materials</h3>

<ul>

<li> To take a quick review for RMI, see the slides: p19-25 of <a
href="../slides/RMI.ppt">RMI.ppt</a>

<li> To take a quick review for UWAgents, see the slides: p21 of <a
href="../slides/Migration.ppt">Migration.ppt</a>

<li> To get the UWAgents user manual, click <a
href="../man/uwagent/UWAgentUserManual.pdf">UWAgentUserManual.pdf</a>

<li> To take a snapshot of the entire X server screen, type:
<pre>
    import -window root X.jpeg
</pre>

<li> To print out a snapshot, start <b>firefox</b>, type
<b>file:///home2</b> in the URL input bar, click your home directory,
reach your current working directory, click <b>X.jpeg</b>, change the
print format in landscape through the page setup menu, and print it
out by selecting <b>uw1-320-p1</b>.

</ul>


<h3>4. What to Turn in</h3>

Turn in the following materials to CollectIt by the due date of Program 3:
<ol>
<li> <strike>Your RMI programs, (i.e., Client.java and Server.java)</strike>
<li> <strike>Your RMI execution output</strike>
<li> Your mobile agent program, (i.e., MyAgent.java)
<li> Your agent execution output
</ol>
