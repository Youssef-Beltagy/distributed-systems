<h3>1. Purpose</h3>

This laboratory work intends to let you understand how to code and run
RMI programs, so that you can focus on your HW3's code design. 

<h3>2. Statement of Work</h3>

We will re-implement Lab1a: EchoServer.java with RMI. However, we are
not using the original TCP-based EchoServer.java at all. 

<ol>

<li> Look at ~css434/lab3a. You can access Client.java and
Server.java. The client identifies the server through Naming.lookup()
and calls its echo() function. On the other hand, the server
instantiates a ServerImplementation object and registers it through
Naming.rebind(). Whenever a client calls the server's echo(), the
server returns the message back to the client's receiveMessage().

<li> You can look at ServerInterface.java. Implement
ServerImplementation.java that should include its constructor and
echo() function. The echo() function should just call the client's
receiveMessage().

<li> Thereafter, look at ClientInterface.java and implement
ClientImplementation.java. The latter should include its constructor
and receiveMessage() fucntion. The receiveMessage() function should
just print out a given message through System.out.println().


</ol>

<h3>3. Related Materials</h3>

<ul>

<li> To take a quick review for RMI, see the slides: p19-25 of <a
href="../slides/RMI.ppt">RMI.ppt</a>

<li> To take a snapshot of the entire X server screen, type:
<pre>
    import -window root X.jpeg
</pre>

</ul>

<h3>4. What to Turn in</h3>

Turn in the following materials to Canvas by the due date of Program 3:
<ol>
<li> Your ClientImplementation.java and ServerImplementation.java 
<li> Your execution output, (e.g., X.jpeg)
</ol>
