<h3>1. Purpose</h3>

This laboratory work intends to mitigate your steep learning curve on
MPI Java. You are to code and run an MPI Java program that includes
MPI.COMM_WORLD.Send( ) and MPI.COMM_WORLD.Recv( )

<h3>2. Statement of Work</h3>

<ol>

<li> Code an MPI java program that executes the following square root
computation:

<ul>
<li><b>rank 0:</b> creates an array of 100 "double" elements, (say,
dArray[100]); sends dArray[25] through to dArray[49] to rank 1,
dArray[50] through to dArray[74] rank 2, and dArray[75] through to
dArray[99] to rank3; thereafter computes "sqrt" of dArray[0] through
to dArray[24]; and finally receives the results from the other ranks.
Use MPI.COMM_WORLD.Send( ) and MPI.COMM_WORLD.Recv( ) to send and
receive an array with a remote rank. (Don't try to communicate with
rank0 itself, which hangs up communication.) At the very end, print
out all array elements.

<li><b>other ranks:</b> creates an array of 25 "double" elements,
(say, dArray[25]); receives data in dArray[0] through to dArray[24]
from rank 0; thereafter computes "sqrt" of all the array elements; and
finally sends the results to rank 0. Use MPI.COMM_WORLD.Recv( ) and
MPI.COMM_WORLD.Send( ) to receive from and send an array to rank 0.

</ul>

<li> Make sure that you have set up your MPI execution envrionment first.

<li> Compile and run your MPI java program by typing:
<pre>
   javac MyProgram.java
   mpirun -n 4 java MyProgram
</pre>

</ol>

<h3>4. What to Turn in</h3>

Turn in the following materials to Canvas by the due date of Program 2:
<ol>
<li> Your MPI java program, (i.e., MyProgram.java)
<li> Your execution output, (i.e., output.txt)
</ol>
