<h3>1. Purpose</h3>

This laboratory work intends to let you understand how to code and run
mobile agents, so that you can focus on your HW3's code design.

<h3>2. Statement of Work</h3>

<ol>
<li> Read <a href="hw3.pdf">program 3's specification</a> carefully to
understand how to run UWAgent.

<li> Code a simple mobile agent, say MyAgent.java that migrates to
cssmpi1h, thereafter cssmpi2h, and finally cssmpi3h in this
order as printing out "hop", "step", and "jump" at a respective
site. Please note that you can choose any three different
computing nodes other than cssmpi1h, 2h, and 3h.

</ol>
