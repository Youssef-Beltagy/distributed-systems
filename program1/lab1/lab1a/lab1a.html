<h3>1. Purpose</h3>

This laboratory work intends to get you used to Java socket
programming under the Unix environment. After the professor explains
about the cssmpiNh machine configuration, the Linux envorinment, and
Java sockets, you are to complete and run a simple server programs
with Java sockets.

<h3>2. Statement of Work</h3>

Complete a /CSSDIV/classes/434/lab1a/EchoSErver.java that receives an ASCII
message from a telnet client nad simply echos it back to the client.

<ul>

<li><b>EchoServer.java:</b> opens a ServerSocket at a given port and
goes into the following loop: (1) wait for a new client connection,
(2) read a byte message, (3) simply echo it back, and (4) close this
client conneciton.

</ul>

To compile your programs, type:
<pre>
   [css434@cssmpi1h lab1a]$ javac EchoServer.java
</pre>

Run your server program first and thereafter telnet
<pre>
   [css434@cssmpi1h lab1a]$ java EchoServer 28000

   [css434@cssmpi2h ~]$ telnet cssmpi1h 28000
   Trying 10.158.82.61...
   Connected to cssmpi1h.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   Hi!
   Hi!
   Connection closed by foreign host.
   [css434@cssmpi2h ~]$ 
</pre>

Cut and paste the results into a file.
