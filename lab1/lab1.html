<h3>1. Purpose</h3>

This laboratory work intends to get you used to Java socket
programming under the Unix environment. After the professor explains
about the LAB-320's machine configuration, the Linux envorinment, and
Java sockets, you are to code and run simple client/server programs
with Java sockets.

<h3>2. Statement of Work</h3>

Code a client and a server program that exchange an array of doubles
as follows.

<ul>

<li><b>Client:</b> instantiates an array of 100 doubles, initializes
all those doubles to 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, .. 99.0, and sends this array
to the server through a Java socket. The client receives an array of
doubles back from the server and prints out each array element.

<li><b>Server:</b> receives an array of doubles, updates each element
with its square root, and sends it back to the client.

</ul>

To compile your programs, type:
<pre>
   [mickey@uw1-320-20]$ javac Client.java Server.java
</pre>

Run your server program first and thereafter your client:
<pre>
   [mickey@uw1-320-21]$ java Server
   [mickey@uw1-320-20]$ java Client > output
</pre>

Print out your client and server programs as well as output
<pre>
   [mickey@uw1-320-21]$ a2ps -PUW1-320-p1 Client.java
   [mickey@uw1-320-20]$ a2ps -PUW1-320-p1 Server.java
   [mickey@uw1-320-20]$ a2ps -PUW1-320-p1 output
</pre>

<h3>3. Related Materials</h3>

<ul>
<li> To understand Java sockets, see the slides: p5 - 7 of <a
href="../slides/IPC.ppt">IPC.ppt</a>
<li> For object serialization, use the ObjectOutputStream class. 
See the slide p9 of IPC.ppt and 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/">Java API Documentation</a>
<li> For object de-serialization, use the ObjectInputStream class. 
See the slide p9 of IPC.ppt and 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/">Java API
Documentation</a>
<li> To compute a square root, use Math.sqrt( ).
</ul>
<h3>4. What to Turn in</h3>

Turn in the following materials to CollectIt by the due date of Program 1:
<ol>
<li> Your client and erver programs, (i.e., Client.java and Server.java)
<li> Your execution output, (i.e., output)
</ol>
