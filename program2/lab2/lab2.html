<h3>1. Purpose</h3>

This laboratory work intends to mitigate your steep learning curve on
MPI Java. After the professor explains how to use MPI Java and
demonstrates an execution of ~css434/hw2/MatrixMult.java, you are to
code and run an MPI Java program that includes MPI.COMM_WORLD.Send( )
and MPI.COMM_WORLD.Recv( )

<h3>2. Statement of Work</h3>

<ol>

<li> Set up your execution enviornment:
<pre>
The process for setting it up to run the first time for each user is
cumbersome.  After the initial user set-up it works well without much
fuss.

# login as self
# make file .mpd.conf  vi/emacs/pico .mpd.conf
# in it write one line:
secretword=<secretword>

where <secretword> is a secure key you create but not your normal password
save the file

# set the correct permissions on this file (other permissions won't work)
chmod 600 .mpd.conf

# create the mpd.hosts file in your working directry where you run your
program. The file should include a list of uw1-320 machines as seen in
~css534/lab2/mpd.hosts:

uw1-320-10.uwb.edu
uw1-320-11.uwb.edu
uw1-320-12.uwb.edu
uw1-320-13.uwb.edu

# edit .bash_profile file as follows:

export PATH=/usr/apps/mpich121-`uname -p`/bin:$PATH
export JAVAPATH=/usr/java/latest
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/apps/mpiJava-`uname -p`/lib/classes:.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/apps/mpiJava-`uname -p`/lib
export PATH=/usr/apps/mpiJava-`uname -p`/src/scripts:$JAVAPATH/bin:$PATH

# either relogin or type at the command line:
# source .bash_profile

# test that your set-up works on the current host
mpd &
mpiexec -n 1 /bin/hostname
mpdallexit

# if you get an error or warning this is a problem.
# You should get the hostname of your current host

**  Need to be able to ssh without a password to other machines in order to
use MPICH.  If this is not already set up:
**************************************************************************
**  ssh-keygen -t rsa                                                   **
**  #  at "Enter file in which to save key", <enter> to accept default  **
**  #  at "Enter passphrase" <enter> to keep the passphrase empty.      **
**  #  do the same thing again                                          **
**  #  then go to the .ssh directory                                    **
**  # and change the name of id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys              **
**  cd .ssh                                                             **
**  mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys                                       **
**  # ssh to all lab machines to set up                                 **
**  # first ssh need to respond "yes" to "continue connecting"          **
**************************************************************************

The first time a new host is added to the first "ring"; it needs to be
established by a "yes" response to "continue connecting".  Every time the
output hangs, type "yes".

You can get all 32 hosts by starting a ring of 4 and typing "yes" 4
times, then starting a ring of 8 (the original 4 plus 4 more) and
typing "yes" 4 times.  After the initial 8, I had to add one at a
time, with the new host always being the last.

Once you have added all the hosts in this way, you never have to type
"yes" again, they were all established for mpich.

mpdboot -n 4 -v
mpdallexit
mpdboot -n 8 -v
mpdallexit

Note that you have to list 8  machine names in your mpd.hosts file
before typeing "mpdboot -n 8 -v".

Now, you are ready to run a mpiJava program.
To compile:
javac *.java

To run
mpdboot -n #cpus -v
prunjava #cpus Hello
prunjava #cpus MatrixMult size

To stop
mpdallexit
</pre>

<li> Code an MPI java program that executes the following square root
computation:

<ul>
<li><b>rank 0:</b> creates an array of 100 "double" elements, (say,
dArray[100]); sends dArray[25] through to dArray[49] to rank 1,
dArray[50] through to dArray[74] rank 2, and dArray[75] through to
dArray[99] to rank3; thereafter computes "sqrt" of dArray[0] through
to dArray[24]; and finally receives the results from the other ranks.
Use MPI.COMM_WORLD.Send( ) and MPI.COMM_WORLD.Recv( ) to send and
receive an array with a remote rank. (Don't try to communicate with
rank0 itself, which hangs up communication.) At the very end, print
out all array elements.

<li><b>other ranks:</b> creates an array of 25 "double" elements,
(say, dArray[25]); receives data in dArray[0] through to dArray[24]
from rank 0; thereafter computes "sqrt" of all the array elements; and
finally sends the results to rank 0. Use MPI.COMM_WORLD.Recv( ) and
MPI.COMM_WORLD.Send( ) to receive from and send an array to rank 0.

</ul>

<li> Make sure that you have set up your MPI execution envrionment first.

<li> Compile and run your MPI java program by typing:
<pre>
   javac MyProgram.java
   prunjava 4 MyProgram > output 2> /dev/null
</pre>

<li> Due to some version inconsistency between mpiJava and the
underlying MPICH, MPICH complains upon MPI.COMM_WORLD.Finalize( ),
which however has no side-effect onto computation and actually
completes your program in success. As shown above, this runtime
complaint can be discarded with <i>2> /dev/null</i>.
